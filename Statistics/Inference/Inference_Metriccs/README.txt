Homework Version: 1.2

Each directory within this folder corresponds to a distinct homework problem. 
To work on a homework problem, start a Jupyter notebook server, and navigate
to that problem's directory in Jupyter's file-viewer. The homework problem
is described in full in the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file). You are to
write your solution in that notebook. 

An automated grader will evaluate your code in the notebook. If all of its tests are passed, 
a hash (a long string of random characters) will be printed out. Paste this hash 
into the appropriate field on the BWSI EdX page, and you will be given credit 
for the problem. There is no limit to the number of times that you run the grader.

The following are brief descriptions of each problem, along with a list of the 
essential concepts required for the concept, as found in the "Python Like You
Mean It" website: https://rsokl.github.io/Learning_Python/
